Audit every AI model call in the codebase and output a complete routing table.

## Steps

### 1. Find the model config
Search for where models are configured. Common patterns:
```bash
grep -r "gpt-4\|claude\|gemini\|anthropic\|openai" --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" -l
grep -r "MODEL\|model_config\|AI_MODEL\|LLM" --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" -l
```
Read those files. Understand the alias → actual model name mapping.
Example: an alias `"fast"` might map to `"gpt-4o-mini"`, an alias `"quality"` to `"claude-opus-4-6"`.

### 2. Find every AI call in the codebase
Search for API call patterns:
```bash
grep -rn "\.chat\.completions\.create\|anthropic\.messages\|genai\.\|\.generate\|embeddings\.create" --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"
```
Also search for your specific client/wrapper function names found in step 1.

For each call, note:
- Which feature/endpoint triggers it
- Which model alias or model name is passed
- Roughly what it does (generation, embedding, classification, etc.)

### 3. Cross-reference alias → actual model name
Using the config from step 1, resolve every alias to the real model name being sent to the API.

### 4. Look for unused model configs
Any model configured but never called from a user-facing feature? Flag it.

### 5. Output the routing table

```
AI MODEL ROUTING — [your product name]
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FEATURE                    ALIAS/KEY       ACTUAL MODEL
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[feature name]             [alias]         [real model name]
[feature name]             [alias]         [real model name]
...
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

UNUSED CONFIG (defined but never called from frontend):
  [alias] → [model name]

FLAGS:
  ⚠️  [anything unexpected, deprecated models, mismatches]
```

### 6. Flag problems
- Any alias pointing to a model that's been deprecated or renamed
- Any feature using an expensive model where a cheaper one would work
- Any hardcoded model names scattered around the codebase instead of going through the central config (these are the ones that don't get updated when you change models)
- Inconsistency: same task using different models in different places

### 7. If the user asks for recommendations
Suggest where swapping to a cheaper/faster model would have low risk (simple tasks, high volume, latency-sensitive) and where quality matters more (user-facing generation, complex reasoning).
